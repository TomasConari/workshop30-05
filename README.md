# Crypto Currency Web App

This was an exercise that fetched data from the Coingecko API to display 
cryptocurrencies on the screen. The application included a search bar to 
search among the coins and included a chart showing their value change.
However, it was a time-limited activity, so the chart remains unfinished.

How to see it?

    1. Download/clone the repository.
    2. Open the terminal and navigate to the repository location.
    3. Run "npm install" in your terminal.
    4. Run "npm start" in your terminal.
